DAMIEN is wearing a breathing mask, he approaches CHRIS.


CHRIS cowers behind the chair, fearful, as damien resembles Darth Vader in his mask.


Damien: what the hell is wrong with you man?


DAMIEN leans over CHRIS and flicks a switch turning off the smoke alarm, he turns back to CHRIS and lifts his mask


Damien: What are you doin down there, you lose you contacts or something?

Chris: (shaking Damien) 'Damien?...wh..wh..where the fuck are we, what the hell is going on, why are you wearing a gas mask?!

Damien: We're 65 000 000 light years from Alpha Centaurai just around the corner from the Orbiting Sandworm Nurseries of Giedi
              Prime & Harrys Fine Bio Synthetic Foods, and my name's not Damien, it's Captain Isaac.

Chris: (hysterical) SANDWORMS?!

Damien: Relax relax, we're not really in space, not real space, you're having a dream.
              Look we're space heros on our way to save the galaxy from re-runs of 'The Three Stooges.'
              It's already corrupted half the deltra quandtrant and it's spreading.

Chris: Ah, so this is all in my imagination, well that explains everything...except why my skin is GREEN!

Damien: You're 'Ziloxybin'; the ships intelligence officer, you're a Limpet Being from the Outer Smog Rings of Jupiter 2.

Chris: LIMPET BEING?!

Damien: No no!, it's really cool man, you're an alien, you can do all sorts of cool shit.

Chris: What..hang about in rock pools eating seaweed? and whats this?!.


CHRIS lifts his arm, it is dripping with goo.


Damien: Oh that's just your protective brine.

Chris: Eeeww its disgusting.. Wait..How come I'm the freaky slug pus, and you're the stereotypical hero...It's my dream!

Damien: Well I might look like the hero, but you're the smart one: Limpet Beings are the smartest lifeforms in the Delta
              Quadrant, you should know that.

Chris: Smart? I repeated grade two, what do I know?

Damien: I don't know it's your dream, but you are smart, wait and see...


Emir: Well Isaacs tell you what, seeing as I'm such a reasonable guy, loved and adored by legions for my kindness and generosity,
         and the fact that I'm off my wheeling nebula, I think this is all a big laugh anyway, so lets just forget about it.

Damien: Really?

Emir: No, just kidding. Look Isaacs, let me give you some advice.

Damien: Your taking our...

Emir: In a deep space survival situation one should always be prepared for any emergency and carry a spare engine onboard just in
         case...so well be needing this one too. This is your Overlord and master, bring us back.


Ivan: Hello to you space cowboy. You have reached Avon 4, subdivision dispatch outpost beacon for 'Pop Goes the Weazle'
         corporation, How may we be of assistance to you?


Damien: So wanna meet the crew? say hello to Grandma.

Chris: Grandma, Grandma who? shes not my Grandma.

Damien: She's Grandma.

Chris: Yeah, but whos Grandma, Grandma who?

Damien: She's Grandma.

Chris: Is she your Grandma, she's not my Grandma, what's her name?

Damien: SHE'S JUST GRANDMA OK! WE CALL HER GRANDMA!.. the Janitor.

Chris: Janitor? It's a bus, why do we need an extra body onboard breathing up all the oxygen?

Damien: Well for one it's your dream and two: if she weren't here with her mop we'd be up to our ankles in salty limpet brine,
              and besides you don't need oxygen... Ah, we're here.

Chris: Here?.. where?

Damien: Androdgina: the fractured moon of Rishi Maze...Zilo, take us in.

Chris: Yes Captain, activating Primary Inertia Dampeners and engaging Auxilery Horizontal Boosters... hmmm That's strange, we've
          stopped.

Damien: Well what's the hold-up?

Chris: Ah, Tribble dung in the exhaust Captain, purging now.

Damien: Damn Tribbles they're worse than Mynocks. Alert me me when we've landed, I'm gonna go chase the Nexus (touches nose
              and winks) if you know what I mean.



Exterior - Androdjina


Bo - tox: Welcome Captain Isaac I am Bo - tox leader of the Coladjin, and this is my daughter Li - Po.

Tiska: Master Bo - tox, some Curlys have snuck into our village during the night and have stolen the strangers Iron Beast.

Damien: You mean the Weasel.

Chris: Why would they want that heap of rubbish?

Damien: You know for one of the most advanced beings in the galaxy you sure do ask a lot of questions. (sigh) Obviously the
              Curlys think the Weasel is a weapon of some kind and want to use it against the Shemps.

Damien: In fact your own spieces for all it's stoicism almost succumb to Stoogism, you're lucky we turned up when we did, you'd
              almost turned into a Shemp.

 

Bo - tox: You must consumate with our god Ho Ho Ba... The Devourer.

Chris: WHAT?!  well screw that!

Damien: I think that's the idea.

Chris: Be my guest.

Chris: The creature told me it has an object lodged inside causing much pain, if I can remove it, we may gain access. to the


Interior - The Weazel


Damien: They're too far gone, it's too late for them, they're in the advanced stages of Stoogism, nothing can bring them back now.
              Quick deploy the Emergency Stooge Tools!
              If there's one thing victims of Stoogism can't resist, it's hammers and plyers... see they can't help themselves.

Chris: whhoooo That was close... Right, where to now?

Damien: To the Huxley system and the planet Sirius 6B, seems the Akashic have just discoverd the Cathode, we have to warn
              them before it's too late.

Grandma: Ssso, they're at war, and you just gave them weapons... What's that?

Chris: It's a Room Rock, see how it brightens up the place. What you don't have one?

Grandma: It's a rock and it's taking up room, get rid of it.

Chris: But it reminds me of home.

Grandma: It's going out the airlock.

Chris: I don't understand, they're primatives, where do they get a rocket from?

Damien: Dream. Arm forward plasma canons.


TASKA beams onto the Weasel to take girl.


Damien: Zilo expel your briny gas flange!


LI - PO is turned off and leaves so does GRANDMA.
